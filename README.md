# Twitter_Opinion_Scrapper
Just a colab notebook that consists of a Twitter opinion scrapper. Its intention was to capture public opinion about 4 candidates for president in Brazil, so it's mainly in Brazilian Portuguese.<p>
    It utilizes KNN learning to know what is a positive, negative or neutral opinion. It also shows a simple graph comparing the opinions.
   
# Notice: 
To get a Neutral, Positive, and Negative sample of the opinions, i used some sentences that may seem negative or positive towards some candidates. I affirm that the sentences here do not represent or reflect my political opinion or beliefs.
